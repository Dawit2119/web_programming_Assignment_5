        <article>
            The Danakil Depression is found in the Danakil Desert,
            along the borders of Eritrea and Djibouti.  With average temperatures of 35°C – 65°C
            there are days when temperatures exceed 48°C – and an average annual rainfall of between 100 and 200m, 
            it is rightly considered one of the most inhospitable places on earth. The National Geographic went so far as to call it the cruellest.

            Semien Mountains National Park
        </p>
        <article>
            Simien Mountains National Park is one of the national 
            parks of Ethiopia. Located in the Semien (North) Gondar 
            Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Semien 
            Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia. 
            It is home to a number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian 
            wolf and the walia ibex, a wild goat found nowhere else in the world. 
            The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat, also occur within the Simien 
            Mountains. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the park, including the 
            impressive bearded vulture, or lammergeier, with its 3 m (10 ft)) wingspan.</article>

            </p>
            <article>
                Tiya is located in the Soddo Region of Ethiopia. 
                It is best known for its archaeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
                remarkable for its large stone pillars, many of which bear some form of decoration.
                The menhir or stelae, "32 of which are engraved with enigmatic symbols, notably swords," mark a large, 
                prehistoric burial complex. A German ethnographic expedition had visited the site in April 1935, and had found at one hour's 
                journey to the south of the caravan camp the stone monoliths with sword symbol, which had been seen earlier by Neuville and Père Azaïs.
